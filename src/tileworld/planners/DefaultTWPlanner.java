 * DefaultTWPlanner

 * Here is the skeleton for your planner. Below are some points you may want to
 * consider.
 * <p>
 * Description: This is a simple implementation of a Tileworld planner. A plan
 * consists of a series of directions for the agent to follow. Plans are made,
 * but then the environment changes, so new plans may be needed
 * <p>
 * As an example, your planner could have 4 distinct behaviors:
 * <p>
 * 1. Generate a random walk to locate a Tile (this is triggered when there is
 * no Tile observed in the agents memory
 * <p>
 * 2. Generate a plan to a specified Tile (one which is nearby preferably,
 * nearby is defined by threshold - @see TWEntity)
 * <p>
 * 3. Generate a random walk to locate a Hole (this is triggered when the agent
 * has (is carrying) a tile but doesn't have a hole in memory)
 * <p>
 * 4. Generate a plan to a specified hole (triggered when agent has a tile,
 * looks for a hole in memory which is nearby)
 * <p>
 * The default path generator might use an implementation of A* for each of the behaviors
